## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites for your project (software, libraries, APIs, keys, etc.) and how to install them.

```bash
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be

```bash
Give the example
```

And repeat

```bash
until end
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

### Running the tests

This template provides a broad structure that you can tailor to your specific project. Remember, your README should make it as easy as possible for others to understand what your project does, how to install it, and how to use it. 
This template includes many sections that are commonly found in README files. However, you should tailor the template to meet the needs of your specific project.
Not all sections may be necessary, and you may want to include additional sections that are relevant to your project.
For example, if your project has a lot of code, you might want to add a `Code Overview` section. If your project is complex, you might want to add a `Project Structure` section.

Always update your README file as your project evolves. A well-maintained README is key to engaging your audience and helping your project grow.
